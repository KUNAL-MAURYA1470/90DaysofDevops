3.Read About Cron and Crontab, to automate the backup Script

##  What is Cron?
  
  Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Linux and Unix-like operating systems that allows you to schedule tasks to run 
  automatically at specified intervals, such as once a day, once an hour, or even every minute.
  Cron is a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks, such as backups, system updates, and data processing.
 
##  What is Crontab?
  Crontab, short for "cron table," is a configuration file used by the cron daemon to schedule tasks. The crontab file is typically stored in the /etc or /var/spool/cron directory, and each user has their own crontab file.
  The crontab file contains a list of commands or scripts to be executed and the schedule for when each command should be run. Each line of the crontab file specifies a separate command or script, and the format of each line is as follows:
