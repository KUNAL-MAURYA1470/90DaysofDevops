## Day 14 Task: Python Data Types and Data Structures for DevOps

### New day, New Topic.... Let's learn along ðŸ˜‰

### Data Types
- Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. 
- Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.
- Python has the following data types built-in by default: Numeric(Integer, complex, float), Sequential(string,lists, tuples), Boolean, Set, Dictionaries, etc

To check what is the data type of the variable used, we can simply write:
```your_variable=100```
```type(your_variable)```

### Data Structures

 Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation. Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. Python helps to learn the fundamental of these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.


## Tasks
1. Give the Difference between List, Tuple and set. Do Handson and put screenshots as per your understanding.

**Lists:**
- Lists are ordered, mutable sequences of objects.
- List elements are enclosed in square brackets [].
- Lists allow duplicates.
- List elements can be changed or removed after the list is created.

e.g

**Tuples:**
- Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences of objects.
- Tuple elements are enclosed in parentheses ().
- Tuples allow duplicates.
- Tuple elements cannot be changed or removed after the tuple is created.

e.g

**Sets:**
- Sets are unordered, mutable collections of unique objects.
- Set elements are enclosed in curly braces {} or created using the set() function.
- Sets do not allow duplicates.
- Set elements can be added or removed after the set is created.

e.g

2. Create below Dictionary and use Dictionary methods to print your favourite tool just by using the keys of the Dictionary.

3. Create a List of cloud service providers
eg.
```
cloud_providers = ["AWS","GCP","Azure"]
```
Write a program to add `Digital Ocean` to the list of cloud_providers and sort the list in alphabetical order.
