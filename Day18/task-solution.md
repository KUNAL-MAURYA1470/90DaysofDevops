# Day 18 Task: Docker for DevOps Engineers

## Docker Compose
- Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications.
- With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down.
- Learn more about docker-compose [visit here](https://tecadmin.net/tutorial/docker/docker-compose/)

## What is YAML?
- YAML is a data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files. Depending on whom you ask, YAML stands for yet another markup language or YAML ainâ€™t markup language (a recursive acronym), which emphasizes that YAML is for data, not documents. 
- YAML is a popular programming language because it is human-readable and easy to understand.
- YAML files use a .yml or .yaml extension.

# Task-1

Learn how to use the docker-compose.yml file, to set up the environment, configure the services and links between different containers, and also to use environment variables in the docker-compose.yml file. 

## Install Docker Compose: Use the following command to install Docker Compose:

- sudo apt install docker-compose

## Step 2 : Create a docker-compose.yml file inside project folder

## docker-compose down : 
This command stops all the services and cleans up the containers, networks, and images.

# Task-2

## 1.Pull a pre-existing Docker image from a public repository (e.g. Docker Hub) and run it on your local machine. Run the container as a non-root user

## 2.Inspect the container's running processes and exposed ports using the docker inspect command.
### docker inspect <container_name or ID

## 3.Use the docker logs command to view the container's log output.
### docker logs <container_name or ID>

## 4.Use the docker stop and docker start commands to stop and start the container.
### docker stop : To stop one or more running Docker containers.

### docker start : Start one or more stopped containers

## 5. Use the docker rm command to remove the container when you're done.

### docker rm : Remove one or more containers
### docker rm <container_name or ID>
